        <p>
            As a computer engineering student, I had to study Calculus, Physics, and many other Engineering courses. 
            I enjoyed using AutoCAD for creating 2D and 3D model drawings. 
            Because of our Thesis Capstone Project, my enthusiasm on Arduino, C++, sensors, became much wider.
